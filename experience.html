								<h2>Tech Support & Project Manager Co-op</h2><h6><a href="https://www.kritik.io/">@Kritik</a></h6>
									<p>As an 8-month co-op student at Kritik, I provided live chat support to assist university administrators, professors, and students in resolving technical issues, including LMS integrations, ensuring a seamless user experience. <br>I collaborated closely with the product, UX, and development teams to create detailed user stories, test new software, debug technical issues, and contribute to major feature developments.

My contributions extended to troubleshooting urgent issues under pressure, assisting in the testing of new product releases, and proactively reporting bugs to the development team.
