								<p>As a member of a dynamic team, I had the opportunity to collaborate on an exciting project that aimed to revolutionize the learning experience. Our team identified a common problem among students and set out to design a solution that promotes curiosity, self-reflection, and experimentation to enhance learning and discovery.

									Through extensive research and ideation, we developed ImmersEd, a virtual reality educational platform that offers immersive and interactive simulations of real-world environments for learning and skill-building. Our goal was to create an accessible platform that enables students to experience educational sites and environments, regardless of physical limitations, financial constraints, or accessibility issues.
									
									I am proud to have contributed to this project, which was nominated for <strong>two categories, including Best UX Research, Findings, and Applications, and Most Strategic Web-Based Solution.</strong> </p>

							<p>My team and I designed an application called Launchpad as part of our UX project. The goal was to create a platform that helps recent graduates connect with UX professionals, find job opportunities in the industry, receive mentorship, and showcase their achievements and projects.

								We started by conducting user research to understand the needs and pain points of our target users. Based on our findings, we created wireframes and prototypes, which we tested and refined through multiple rounds of user feedback.
								
								We also focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, paying attention to details such as typography, color, and layout. We incorporated features such as a job board, mentorship matching, project showcase, and messaging system, all aimed at providing value to both job seekers and industry professionals.</p>
